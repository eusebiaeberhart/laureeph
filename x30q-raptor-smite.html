Riot says they are changing the spawn time of raptors back to 1:30 from 1:27. I think this is enough to ruin my fav cheese strat in the game :( Here is the source.

I don't know if it's meant to be but I feel like the raptor smite buff shouldn't activate if a ward is already revealed by a Tower or a Pink ward as it wastes Bİlmeyen olabilir bu aralar cok gem fragment kırdırmak isteyen oluyor bu oranlardan ne düsebileceğinden yararlanabilir. Black Gem Cold-Hearted Dagger 1 in 2,000. The oracle lens esq buff given by smiting the raptor buff is in my opinion most useful to be used to spot stealth wards so that you can clear them, so you would think it is pointless to be able to trigger near enemy pink wards- since you can already see them- thus practically wasting the buff. I see this happen in so many games both LCS and in my own games, and it just seems like an off mechanic, since that raptor smite buff can be used to spot multiple stealthed wards, but sometimes

The fall and torment ov shame, I'll smite Heaven's golden pride, And never Just found out that the tooltip for raptorbuff says that you have to be spotted by a ward for it to pop.

bascially title. Happened to me when a Lee Sin ward jumped away from me over a wall to an unwarded. legendary sippers of our time: Prickly Pear Hermes and Cherry Coke Foo by Mod Gwess. Dr Pepper Trish and Baja Blast Bruno by Mod Doppio. Orange soda The World and Grape Crush Killer Queen Dunno if this was discussed before but it is ridiculous that you lose the buff after you discover one blue trinket. I think a good solution to this might be that you get to discover 3 blue trinkets or 1 regular ward/pink ward before 
These Might Be The Strangest Names In Sports Comedian Jerry Seinfeld once said, “Loyalty to any one sports team is pretty hard to justify, because the players are always changing; the team could move to another. In yesterday's game Winterfox vs Dignitas, CloudNguyen had the raptor's smite-buff and it popped when he walked next to a ward, except the ward was at the other side of a wall and there was no way it could see him. There weren't any other enemy wards around, nor did they place any to make the buff pop (it isn't clear in the image, but you can see it if you wach the game). The picture is from the exact moment it popped. I blacked out the stats to prevent spoiling. DAN JOLLEY COMIC BOOK WRITER. Dan Jolley is a writer for comics, games, and novels.

Joe, Transformers, Voltron, Star Wars and World of Warcraft. "If spotted by an ennemy ward, this unit will be alerted and given Magical sight." This mean that I don't have True sight for the whole Razor Sharp's duration. I have true sight from the moment I am spotted and a few seconds onward, allowing me to spot one ward and maybe some nearby wards. But, Vision Ward and Zz'Rot Portal's Void Gate are considered as wards. With the Stealth Ward not purchasable and the Trinkets having a very long cooldown and a short duration, I feel like Razor Sharp 
Action role-playing video games are a subgenre of role-playing video games. The games emphasize real-time combat where the player has direct control  I feel like it shouldn't be used up if the ward it spots is a pink ward or blue trinket. They're already visible regardless so just a waste of the smite bonus. Just a minor thing but would I don't know if this is intentional or not. I mean it says that it will activate when you are spotted by a ward but does it make sense that it actives when beeing spotted by a ward that is visible anyways? Here is a video of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76dnvLjJ6D8. 
Please. In addition to revealing wards, which is very useful for ganking in itself, raptor smite buff reveals Teemo shrooms. So if you play as a jungle against a Teemo, smite the raptors before ganking. Usually Teemo players won't ward against ganks after 6 because they can plant a shroom,and this way you can see other Teemo shrooms on your way to gank. If you play with a Teemo, you should take the other jungler's Raptors so they can't see the shrooms. What is now the most efficient jungle route for Evelynn with the changes to spawn timers? Also how to stay healty kiting effectivly, which i know takes practice more than anything, and essientially not wasting time in the jungle clearing slow which i feel like i do Edit: I am currently doing: Blue(smite) Gromp Wolves Crab Raptors(smite if low) Back for item Red Krug obviously ganking between if an opening. First of all, I don't have much of a problem with the concept of plants, I'm looking forwards to see how they turn out - If they end up frustrating I'm sure Riot and the community can work it out together, but there is one thing about the removal of smite buffs that I would like to see addressed: vision control / ward clearing Just a quick side note here: I'll be commenting on this from a solo-player perspective. Premade teams surely see vision control from a vastly different perspective I usually do like that: BLUE side: red -gt blue (smite) -gt scuttle -gt gank top -gtwolves -gt raptors (smite) back RED side: blue -gt red (smite) -gt raptors -gt wolves (smite) -gt gank mid -gt scuttle back /gromp (smite). Note that: 1. I'm really low elo - I don't play ranked now, but the last time I played I was silver 1. 2. I'm trying to learn jungle 3. Those paths above are probably wrong because their are based mostly of my inexperience and limited intuiti. 
Every single jungle change nerfs Fiddlesticks considerably. Fiddlesticks is no stranger to indirect nerfs (cough Runeglaive cough, cough fear changes cough), but this is absolutely ridiculous. Buff monsters loses their minions: - Fiddlesticks no longer gets bounces with his Dark Wind. For an entire jungle clear this adds over 20 seconds of extra clearing time. This alone kills the champion. - For reference, Nocturne now clears the jungle almost a full MINUTE faster than Fiddlesticks. Since patch 8.10 I'm not really sure what routes are viable for k6. Before this I used to (when at blue side) red, raptors, wolf's, blue look for a lvl3 gank or gromp. At red side I did a full clear starting at blue gromp wolf raptors (smite) red (smite) look for gank or golems. But now I'm not really sure, I personally prefer doing efficient routes since that way you can keep being relevant to the game even if your ganks fail. (Sorry for my bad English, also I'm at mobile). DISCLAIMER: I am not claiming that farming until level 6 is the most optimal jungle path for Shyvana, just merely pointing out this option. ~~BECAUSE IT'S FUCKING FAST~~ --- ###Intro So I just love to theorycraft new jungle routes (I even made a video tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_FQ402UFAkampt=442s) last season about it) so I got some free time to test a multitude of Runes on Shyvana just to see what the fastest possible time to hit level 6 ( without any additional. Hey guys. Irojo here, last season I hovered between d1 and d3 playing mostly wukong jungle. These are my initial thoughts after thorough reading of patch notes and playing about 10 games. I would love to hear your take: - heavy aoe jungles are king. I think this means champions like VI (CoC VI is completely broken like pick ban trust me) ~~amumu~~ and skarner are going to be top tier soloqueue picks, and graves will unsurprisingly remain S tier. - counterjungling is king. Hi, I’m a low-elo support main, and I’ve fallen in love with this tree boi. So here is what I’m trying lately and I wanted to hear from people who main it since his release what they think about it. So basically I’ve found Ivern to be an amazing early game champion, with a very fast clear and a good ganking potential (powerspike at lvl 6). So how to make good use of these unique abilities? First of all, the pathing. Right now I’m trying on blue side to run to enemy red with toplaner/mid/both. Hi, so I recently hit diamond mostly through playing vi ending up with a 75% win rate in 68 games, I mostly played jungle as a secondary role however I tended to switch depending on how games went. I’m fairly new to vi and therefore I’m not an expert this is just what worked for me. Proof - https://gyazo.com/4f2930b1d9389998e922c5a83b6581b3 Ability order should be W then E followed by Q with maxing Q first Red side With red side you start blue, wolves, raptors (smite it) red, golems Hey, I'm a low elo player (placed in Bronze IV, currently at Bronze III and steadily climbing) and I've been playing mostly Hecarim. One thing I've been having trouble with are early invades by the enemy jungler. Level 1 invades are easily counterable since I can just go for the buff opposite to where the enemy team is invading. My issue are second buff invades. I usually go for the following route: Zombie Ward the bush Red near red 40 secs before it spawns, then start Blue (smite), wolves Breeding: Smite x Reader NSFW Lmao, here’s a breeding drabble I wrote with Smite, an ode to the rowdy crowd of dorks on discord.
