It began using steel in place of branches and iron instead of leaves to construct its cocoon. As a result, it was afforded protection from predators and the environment alike. Analyzing the metal insect's carapace inspired us to develop a new weapon: a mechanical bow, capable of firing iron arrows through even the thickest trees. In fact, during our first test firing
